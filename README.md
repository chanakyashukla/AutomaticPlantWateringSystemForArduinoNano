# Automatic Plant Watering System for Arduino Nano

## Introduction

Welcome to the Automatic Plant Watering System for Arduino Nano project! This system provides an automated solution for watering plants using an Arduino Nano. The project is especially beneficial for individuals with plants at home who need a reliable watering system when away.

## Features

- Automatic watering based on soil moisture level.
- Utilizes Arduino Nano for a compact and portable design.
- Simple and intuitive code for easy understanding and modification.

## Code Explanation

The Arduino code monitors the soil moisture level using a soil moisture sensor and controls a water pump through a relay. The pump is activated when the soil is dry and deactivated when it's wet, ensuring optimal moisture levels for the plant.

```cpp
// Arduino code goes here
```

## Modifications

On 2nd Nov 2023, at 14:35, Chanakya Shukla made the following modifications:
- Replaced the relay switch with a direct connection to a DC water motor pump.
- Adjusted code logic for turning on/off the water pump based on soil moisture.

## Usage

1. Connect the Arduino Nano to the soil moisture sensor and water pump.
2. Upload the provided Arduino code to the Nano using the Arduino IDE.
3. Power the system and observe automatic watering based on soil moisture.

Feel free to modify the code or contribute to the project!
